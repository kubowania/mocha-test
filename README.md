# mocha-test
Boilerplate for Mocha tests

This repository is in support of my YouTube tutorial on writing tests in Mocha and Chai for your JavaScript projects. Watch the full video [here](https://youtu.be/Rumf96j0cR0).

In this video I show you how to write your first unit test using Mocha and Chai. Mocha is a popular testing framework that we will be using for this video, along with Chai which is an assertion library.

When you have finished your project I would love for you to share it with me - you can find me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw)  or [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ania_kubow).
